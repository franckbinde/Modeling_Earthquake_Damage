    "# Richter's Predictor: Modeling Earthquake Damage\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a competition hosted by [drivendata.org](https://www.drivendata.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Based on aspects of building location and construction, the goal is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected through surveys by the Central Bureau of Statistics that work under the National Planning Commission Secretariat of Nepal. This survey is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem description\n",
    "We're trying to predict the ordinal variable damage_grade, which represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. There are 3 grades of the damage:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **1** represents low damage\n",
    " - **2** represents a medium amount of damage\n",
    " - **3** represents almost complete destruction\n",
    " \n",
    "## Features\n",
    "The dataset mainly consists of information on the buildings' structure and their legal ownership. Each row in the dataset represents a specific building in the region that was hit by Gorkha earthquake.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 39 columns in this dataset, where the building_id column is a unique and random identifier. The remaining 38 features are described in the section below. Categorical variables have been obfuscated random lowercase ascii characters. The appearance of the same character in distinct columns does not imply the same original value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "- geo_level_1_id, geo_level_2_id, geo_level_3_id (type: int): geographic region in which building exists, from largest (level 1) to most specific sub-region (level 3). Possible values: level 1: 0-30, level 2: 0-1427, level 3: 0-12567.\n",

    "## Performance metric\n",
    "\n",
    "We are predicting the level of damage from 1 to 3. The level of damage is an ordinal variable meaning that ordering is important. This can be viewed as a classification or an ordinal regression problem. (Ordinal regression is sometimes described as an problem somewhere in between classification and regression.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the performance of our algorithms, we'll use the F1 score which balances the precision and recall of a classifier. Traditionally, the F1 score is used to evaluate performance on a binary classifier, but since we have three possible labels we will use a variant called the micro averaged F1 score.\n"

    "\n",
    "Feature selection is a critical part of machine learning. There are several ways to select the most relevant features for a prediction. For instance, one could use the **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** algorithm. We could also use a **LightGBM**, or an **XGBoost** object as long it has a feature_importances_ attribute. The **Pearson Correlation**, which is a filter-based method, could help us to keep the features which have the highest correlation with the target variable. \n",
